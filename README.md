<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<br>
Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis process. It involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values to ensure the quality and reliability of your data. Here are the complete steps involved in data cleaning:

1. Data Acquisition and Inspection:

Gather data from its source (e.g., files, databases, APIs)
Examine data structure and understand the meaning of each variable
Check for file format compatibility and encoding issues
Identify any obvious errors or inconsistencies in the data
2. Handling Missing Values:

Identify missing values and their patterns
Analyze the reasons for missing values and their impact on analysis
Choose appropriate techniques to impute missing values:
Mean/median imputation for numerical data
Mode/category filling for categorical data
Dropping rows/columns with excessive missing values
Using specialized techniques like KNN or Expectation Maximization
3. Addressing Data Inconsistency:

Identify inconsistencies in formatting, units, or coding
Standardize data formats (e.g., date format, currency conversion)
Fix typos and spelling errors
Recategorize or code categorical data consistently
4. Outlier Detection and Treatment:

Identify outliers using statistical methods (e.g., IQR, z-scores)
Analyze the causes of outliers and their potential impact
Choose appropriate techniques to handle outliers:
Winsorization (capping outliers to specific values)
Transformation (e.g., log scaling)
Removal (only if outliers are truly non-representative)
5. Data Transformation and Feature Engineering:

Create new features based on existing ones
Transform features for improved analysis (e.g., scaling, normalization)
Handle categorical data using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding
6. Data Validation and Documentation:

Re-run analysis after cleaning to ensure data integrity
Verify if the cleaning process addressed the initial issues
Document the cleaning process for future reference and reproducibility
Additional Steps:

Data quality checks: Regularly perform checks to ensure data remains clean and consistent over time.
Version control: Maintain different versions of the data to track changes and revert back if needed.
Data cleaning automation: Utilize tools and scripts to automate repetitive cleaning tasks.
Remember: The specific data cleaning steps may vary depending on the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis. The key is to be thorough, systematic, and document your process for a successful and reliable analysis.
